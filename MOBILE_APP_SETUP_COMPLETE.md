## 📝 Important Notes

### Missing Icons
The app references icon files that need to be created:
- `public/icon-192x192.png` - 192x192px app icon
- `public/icon-512x512.png` - 512x512px app icon

**To create icons:**
1. Design your app icon (recommended: 1024x1024px)
2. Generate sizes using a tool like:
   - [App Icon Generator](https://www.appicon.co/)
   - [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-asset-generator)
3. Place icons in `public/` folder

### Permissions
The app will request these permissions automatically:
- **Microphone** - For speech recognition (AI Coach)
- **Speech Recognition** - For voice input
- **Network** - For API calls

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Use `npm run dev` for web testing
- **Mobile Build**: Use `npm run mobile:android` or `npm run mobile:ios`
- **PWA**: App is also installable as PWA from browser
